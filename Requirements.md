### Requirements



Create a simple todo-list application using Angular. Your application must:

1. Allow users to create new todos in the UI.
2. Allow users to mark todos as complete changing its color to green.
3. Allow users to mark todos as "postpone" which will temporarily remove them from the list.
4. Allow users to delete todos from the UI.
5. Add a clean button that will remove the completed todos.
6. Add a restore button that will bring back all the postponed todos.

As a bonus, you may add an edit option if you like or work on the styling.
