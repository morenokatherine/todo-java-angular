# TODO List - Angular

## Requirements

- node 12+

A simple todo-list application using Angular. This application includes:

1. Allow users to create new todos in the UI.
2. Allow users to mark todos as complete changing its color to green.
3. Allow users to mark todos as "postpone" which will temporarily remove them from the list.
4. Allow users to delete todos from the UI.
5. Add a clean button that will remove the completed todos.
6. Add a restore button that will bring back all the postponed todos.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
